# KinomeX

KinomeX is a full-stack research server for exploring the human protein kinase
landscape. It connects kinase identity and classification with molecular
structures, ligand bioactivity, tissue expression, clinically annotated
variants, disease associations, literature, clinical investigation, and a
derived Pharmaceutical Development Interest Score (PDIS).

The server is designed for target exploration and hypothesis generation. It is
not a clinical decision-support system, and PDIS is not a measure of biological
importance, safety, efficacy, or medical recommendation.

## Capabilities

KinomeX currently provides:

- a searchable catalog of curated human kinases;
- Manning-group classification across AGC, CAMK, CK1, CMGC, STE, TK, TKL,
  and Atypical kinases;
- paginated filtering by gene/name, group, organ system, and PDIS interval;
- a dynamic 20-bin PDIS histogram with draggable minimum and maximum bounds;
- a radial D3 kinome tree with group coloring, PDIS-scaled nodes, progressive
  label disclosure, and collision-aware deep zoom;
- curated functional and catalytic-activity annotations imported specifically
  from reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records;
- an interactive STRING kinase-association network with functional/physical
  modes, confidence filtering, zoom/pan, and profile-linked nodes;
- per-kinase profiles combining sequence, structures, ligand assays,
  expression, variants, diseases, references, and PDIS components;
- interactive NGL and Mol* structure visualization;
- an SVG body-expression map and tissue-expression bar chart;

The application joins the normalized MongoDB collections at request time.
There is no separate GraphQL layer or data warehouse. Next.js caches selected
list/distribution responses in process memory for five minutes; a server
restart clears those caches.

## User-facing pages

| Route | Page | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Dashboard | Live summary, search, group filters, and paginated kinase cards |
| `/explorer` | Explorer | Gene/group/organ filtering and interactive PDIS histogram |
| `/tree` | Kinome Tree | Radial D3 overview with searchable kinases, PDIS-scaled nodes, and readable deep-zoom labels |
| `/search` | AI Assistant | Source-aware conversation across KinomeX, UniProt, STRING, connected databases, and verified PubMed literature |
| `/kinases/[gene]` | Kinase profile | Summary grounded in Swiss-Prot function and the high-confidence STRING interactome, followed by curated function and Structure, Distribution, Ligands, Mutations, Network, Diseases, and References tabs |
| `/docs` | Documentation | In-product biological, technical, and reference documentation |

The fixed navigation includes quick search, responsive mobile navigation, and
the KinomeX folded-ribbon identity. The full-screen biomedical background uses
a supplied raster artwork with slow CSS drift, cyan/violet ambient breathing,
and a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback.

## Data sources and provenance

Licensing, attribution, and reuse obligations are recorded in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) and in the **Attributions** tab of the in-application Docs page. Record-level terms remain controlling; ChEMBL-derived records retain CC BY-SA 3.0 ShareAlike obligations, while PubMed abstract copyright is publication-specific.

| Source | Imported or queried information | Primary collection/use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot | reviewed accession, gene symbol, name, sequence, domains, EC number, curated function, catalytic activity, subunit annotations, disease comments | `kinases`, `diseases` |
| KinHub/Manning | core roster, kinase-domain rows, group, family, and subfamily | `kinases`, `catalog_metadata` |
| STRING | human functional or physical protein associations and component confidence scores | live `/api/interactions` network view |
| RCSB PDB | structure identifiers, experimental method, resolution, titles, bound ligands | `structures` |
| ChEMBL | human kinase targets, compounds, assays, standardized activity values, documents | `bioactivities` |
| PubChem | compound enrichment and additional assay/compound records | `bioactivities` |
| GTEx | tissue expression, median TPM, tissue-to-organ mapping, specificity | `expression` |
| ClinVar/NCBI | clinically annotated variants and significance | `variants` |
| PubMed/NCBI E-utilities | publication counts for PDIS and profile references | `pdis`, live profile references |
| ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 | active/completed kinase-inhibitor study counts | `pdis` |
| Manning classification | curated group/family mapping | `kinases` classification |

Every external dataset remains subject to its provider's license, attribution,
rate-limit, and redistribution terms. Source APIs can revise records
independently of KinomeX. A successful ETL run indicates that the configured
requests and database writes completed; it does not independently certify the
scientific correctness of every upstream record.

## Database model

The default database is `kinomex`. Collection names are centralized in
`etl/database.py`.

### `kinases`

Canonical metadata used to anchor all other collections.

Important fields include `gene_symbol`, `uniprot_id`, `full_name`, `group`,
`subfamily`, `ec_number`, `protein_sequence`, `seq_length`, `keywords`,
`reviewed`, and domain boundaries. `uniprot_id` is unique; `gene_symbol` and
`ec_number` are indexed.

### `structures`

RCSB structure records such as `pdb_id`, associated gene/accession fields,
title, resolution, experimental method, and bound ligands. `pdb_id` is unique;
gene and resolution fields are indexed. Profile responses currently return at
most 20 structures per kinase.

### `bioactivities`

ChEMBL and PubChem compound/assay records. Typical fields include
`compound_id`, `target_chembl_id`, `target_gene_symbol`, `pubchem_cid`,
`assay_type`, `standard_value`, `standard_units`, document identifiers, and
source metadata. Profile responses currently return at most 200 records and
normalize supported units to nM for display.

### `expression`

One record per gene/tissue combination, including `gene_symbol`, `tissue_site`,
`median_tpm`, `organ_system`, `tau`, and source. The gene/tissue pair is unique.

### `variants`

Variant records including gene/accession, mutation code, residue position,
reference and alternate amino acids, clinical significance/pathogenicity,
gatekeeper status, resistance context, and literature identifiers. Gene,
pathogenicity, and accession/mutation combinations are indexed.

### `diseases`

One gene-level document containing a `diseases` array. Disease items can
include `disease_id`, description, and OMIM identifier.

### `pdis`

One document per gene with `pdis_total` on a 0–100 storage scale, normalized
component values, raw counts, and source metadata. API responses generally
divide the total by 100 and expose a 0–1 display scale.

### `etl_runs`

Singleton scheduled-job state and audit history. It stores the current lease,
status, timestamps, latest per-step results, the latest error, and the last 20
run summaries. The document `_id` is `scheduled-source-refresh`.

## Pharmaceutical Development Interest Score (PDIS)

PDIS is an exploratory ranking signal intended to summarize how much
pharmaceutical-development evidence surrounds a kinase. It must not be
interpreted as clinical advice or intrinsic biological importance.

### Current implemented calculation

The executable calculator in `etl/ingestors/pdis_calculator.py` currently uses:

```text
PDIS = (0.30 × citation
      + 0.30 × clinical_trials
      + 0.15 × structure
      + 0.15 × compound_diversity) / 0.90
```

Each component is calculated on a 0–100 scale:

- **Citation:** `log10(publication_count + 1) / log10(max_count + 1) × 100`,
  using a PubMed query for the gene and kinase terms.
- **Clinical trials:** `min(100, trial_count / 100 × 100)`, using selected
  active or completed ClinicalTrials.gov statuses.
- **Structure:** 60% best-resolution score plus 40% average-resolution score,
  with the useful interval bounded approximately between 1.5 and 4.0 Å.
- **Compound diversity:** log-normalized distinct ChEMBL/PubChem compound
  count linked to the kinase gene.

The calculator refuses to run if verified RCSB structure or ChEMBL/PubChem
imports are absent, or if development-seed records are present. A missing PDIS
document therefore means “not currently verifiable,” never a score of zero.

If the calculation changes, stored PDIS documents must be regenerated by
running the `pdis` target (which automatically includes its prerequisites).

## API reference

All routes return JSON except `/api/chat`, which streams Server-Sent Events
(SSE). Error responses use an `error` string and an appropriate HTTP status.

### `GET /api/kinases`

Returns a validated, enriched, paginated kinase list.

| Parameter | Default | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search` | empty | Gene/full-name substring; maximum 100 characters; regex-escaped |
| `group` | empty | `AGC`, `CAMK`, `CK1`, `CMGC`, `STE`, `TK`, `TKL`, or `Atypical` |
| `organ_system` | empty | Maximum 50 characters; aliases such as brain→CNS are resolved |
| `minPDIS` | `0` | Finite number on display scale 0–1 |
| `maxPDIS` | `1` | Finite number on display scale 0–1; must be ≥ minimum |
| `page` | `1` | Positive integer |
| `limit` | `20` | Positive integer, capped at 100 |
| `sort` | `gene_symbol` | Allowlisted field; prefix `-` for descending order |

Allowed sort fields are `gene_symbol`, `full_name`, `group`, `subfamily`, and
`uniprot_id`. Organ and PDIS gene sets are resolved before counting and
pagination, so `total` and `totalPages` describe the filtered result. Kinases
without a PDIS document return `pdis_score: null` and are excluded whenever a
PDIS interval is explicitly requested.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "kinases": [],
  "total": 0,
  "page": 1,
  "totalPages": 0,
  "groupBreakdown": {}
}
```

Each returned kinase includes its gene symbol, name, group, subfamily,
UniProt ID, normalized PDIS, organ systems, disease identifiers, and mutation
count. `groupBreakdown` is aggregated from the complete filtered population
before pagination; its values therefore sum to `total` and are never limited
to the current page. Successful non-empty results are cached in the server
process for five minutes.

### `GET /api/kinases/distribution`

Returns 20 PDIS buckets over the stored 0–100 range for the current
`search`, `group`, and `organ_system` filters. It deliberately ignores the
selected PDIS interval so the Explorer histogram remains stable while its
handles move. Kinases without a score are reported separately as `unscored`
and are not placed into a scored bucket.

### `GET /api/kinases/stats`

Returns total kinase, ligand/bioactivity, variant, structure, and disease
document counts; group distribution; average normalized PDIS; and top-mutated
and top-PDIS lists.

### `GET /api/kinases/[gene]`

Returns the unified kinase profile used by the detail page. Gene matching is
case-insensitive and exact. A profile request can additionally query ChEMBL to
resolve a target identifier and PubMed to assemble recent references; those
live lookups use five-second timeouts and degrade to locally available data.

Status codes include `400` for a missing gene, `404` when no kinase is found,
and `500` for an unexpected profile failure.

### `GET /api/interactions`

Retrieves human STRING associations for up to 50 validated protein symbols.
`network_type` accepts `functional` or `physical`, `score` sets the required
confidence from 0–1000, and `add_nodes` requests up to 50 neighboring proteins.
The kinase dossier uses one focal gene plus 20 neighbors and presents both an
interactive graph and a ranked evidence-score table. STRING associations can
represent functional or physical evidence and do not by themselves establish
direct binding. The Network tab follows Mutations. Clicking its focal kinase
returns to the KinomeX dossier; neighboring proteins open STRING using its
species-qualified canonical form,
`https://string-db.org/network/homo_sapiens/[gene]`.

### `POST /api/ai-search`

Accepts:

```json
{ "query": "high PDIS TK kinases associated with melanoma" }
```

`parseQuery()` extracts group, tissue, disease, binding, and PDIS concepts,
then searches local collections. Tissue, disease, and binding evidence is
resolved to gene sets and intersected with the requested kinase group and
free-text constraints. Results are enriched, ranked, and sliced to at most 50
records. When the local intersection is empty, the route retrieves relevant
PubMed articles that contain a PMID, DOI, title, and abstract and returns them
as external evidence. This route is rule-based; it does not call an LLM.

### `POST /api/chat`

Accepts a non-empty `messages` array containing only `user` and `assistant`
roles. Limits are 40 messages, 8,000 characters per message, and 24,000 total
characters. The route retrieves up to 15 relevant database records, adds them
to a fixed system prompt, and streams completion deltas:

```text
data: {"content":"..."}

data: [DONE]
```

The endpoint returns `501` when `LLM_API_KEY` is absent, `503` when database
context is unavailable, and `502` for an upstream language-model failure.

## Local installation

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer and npm
- Python 3.10 or newer
- MongoDB 7-compatible server, local or remote
- `lsof` for the convenience launcher's stop command

### Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dokhlab/kinomex.git
cd kinomex
npm install

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r etl/requirements.txt
cp etl/.env.example etl/.env
```

### Application environment

Create `.env.local` in the repository root:

```dotenv
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/kinomex
AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters

# Optional conversational AI
LLM_API_KEY=your_key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### ETL environment

`etl/config.py` loads `etl/.env`. Available settings are:

| Variable | Required | Default/purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MONGODB_URI` | No | `mongodb://localhost:27017/kinomex` |
| `UNIPROT_API_URL` | No | UniProt REST root |
| `RCSB_API_URL` | No | RCSB search endpoint |
| `CHEMBL_API_URL` | No | ChEMBL API root |
| `PUBCHEM_API_URL` | No | PubChem PUG REST root |
| `GTEX_API_URL` | No | GTEx v2 API root |
| `NCBI_EUTILS_URL` | No | NCBI E-utilities root |
| `PUBMED_API_KEY` | No | Raises permitted NCBI request throughput |

Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, database credentials, or API keys. These
patterns are excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Running KinomeX

The repository-local launcher prepares the database and then starts Next.js:

```bash
./run              # start on port 3007
./run 3010         # start on another port
./run -s           # gracefully stop KinomeX on port 3007
./run -s 3010      # gracefully stop KinomeX on another port
```

The launcher:

1. validates the requested TCP port;
2. exits successfully when KinomeX is already listening on that port, or
   refuses to overwrite an unrelated listener;
3. verifies that `python3` and `npm` are available;
4. ensures MongoDB is reachable, starting a local Homebrew service when needed;
5. runs `python3 -m etl.auto_populate` and waits for all required catalogue
   migrations to finish;
6. writes preparation output to `etl/auto_populate.log` and stops on failure;
7. starts `npm run dev -- -p <port>` only after the database is current;
8. refuses to stop a listener whose working directory is not this repository.

Run Next.js without automatic population:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3007
```

Production mode:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start -- -p 3007
```

## ETL and database population

### Startup population guard

`python3 -m etl.auto_populate` is a version-aware local startup guard. If the
kinase collection is empty, it imports and reconciles UniProt and KinHub
metadata. For an existing database, it checks the recorded startup schema and
the required fields themselves. The current migration refreshes the reconciled
catalogue when Swiss-Prot function, catalytic activity, subunit, section, or
annotation-source fields are absent. It then:

- records completed migrations in `catalog_metadata` under
  `_id: startup-migrations`;
- exits with an error if a required update fails or remains incomplete, so the
  website cannot start against a partially migrated catalogue;
- reports which scientific evidence collections are absent;
- never invents or seeds structures, bioactivities, variants, diseases,
  expression values, or PDIS scores;
- directs operators to the source ETL for missing evidence.

This guard is not a substitute for a full production ingestion.

### Production ETL

List steps:

```bash
python3 -m etl.pipeline --list-steps
```

Run every step:

```bash
python3 -m etl.pipeline
```

Run target steps:

```bash
python3 -m etl.pipeline uniprot
python3 -m etl.pipeline chembl pubchem
python3 -m etl.pipeline pdis
```

Ligand records are source-bounded rather than inferred. The ChEMBL step maps
every catalogue accession to human ChEMBL targets, preserves each quantitative
source activity by its ChEMBL activity ID, and the dossier presents one row per
distinct source compound (with its most potent measurement and supporting
record count). Investigational development candidates are displayed separately
from quantitative binding assays and require a trial-registry or primary-source
link. After a ligand refresh, generate the per-kinase integrity report with:

```bash
pnpm audit:ligands
```

The report is written to `reports/ligand-coverage.json`. A kinase with no row
means that the connected sources returned no mapped record; it must not be
interpreted as evidence that no ligand exists. Nonzero
`records_missing_gene_symbol` or `invalid_chembl_records` indicates an
incomplete legacy import that should not be presented as audited coverage.

The 13 August 2026 audited snapshot contains 1,019,354 ChEMBL activity records
and 2,085 PubChem records mapped to 566 catalogue genes. The remaining 112
catalogue genes had no mapped record in those connected source snapshots; this
is a source-coverage statement, not evidence that ligands do not exist. The
audit found no missing gene symbols, invalid live ChEMBL records, orphan gene
mappings, or duplicate ChEMBL activity identifiers. The dossier Ligands view
keeps curated development candidates separate from quantitative binding
assays. Binding assays can be searched and filtered by value range, activity
type, and assay; columns are resizable and results paginate at 100 compounds
per page.

Dependencies are included automatically and run in topological order. For
example, requesting `pdis` schedules `uniprot`, `pdb`, `chembl`, `gtex`,
`clinvar`, `diseases`, and finally `pdis`.

| Step | Depends on | Main effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uniprot` | — | Kinase metadata and sequences |
| `pdb` | `uniprot` | Structural coverage |
| `chembl` | `uniprot` | ChEMBL assays and compounds |
| `pubchem` | `uniprot`, `chembl` | Compound/assay enrichment |
| `gtex` | `uniprot` | Tissue expression |
| `clinvar` | `uniprot` | Clinical variants |
| `diseases` | `uniprot` | UniProt disease annotations |
| `pdis` | all relevant upstream steps | Recomputed development-interest score |

Steps report record counts and elapsed time. An individual failed step is
recorded, later steps continue, and the command exits non-zero if any step
failed.

## Automatic source updates

`.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml` runs every Sunday at **03:17 UTC** and
supports manual dispatch with optional space-separated ETL targets.

Required GitHub repository configuration:

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KINOMEX_MONGODB_URI` | Yes | Network-accessible production MongoDB URI |
| `PUBMED_API_KEY` | Recommended | PubMed/NCBI rate allowance |

The workflow installs Python 3.12 and `etl/requirements.txt`, validates the
database secret, allowlists manual target names, and invokes
`python -m etl.scheduled_update`.

The scheduled updater:

- acquires an atomic lease in MongoDB before ingestion;
- skips safely if another refresh owns the lease;
- uses a six-hour default lease and validates custom lease bounds;
- runs all sources or the requested dependency-expanded subset;
- returns non-zero when any ETL step fails;
- stores latest status/results/error and 20 historical summaries;
- uses GitHub Actions concurrency to avoid duplicate workflow jobs.

Run the same protected refresh locally:

```bash
python3 -m etl.scheduled_update
python3 -m etl.scheduled_update uniprot diseases pdis
python3 -m etl.scheduled_update --lease-minutes 480
```

The application reads MongoDB at request time, so a successful refresh does
not require a rebuild. Existing in-memory API entries can remain visible for
up to five minutes.

## AI assistant

KinomeX provides one AI-powered research conversation. Each question first
runs deterministic parsing and MongoDB retrieval. Functional free text also
searches reviewed Swiss-Prot function, catalytic-activity, and subunit
annotations. Interaction questions additionally retrieve high-confidence
STRING associations for matched kinases. The assistant then uses an
OpenAI-compatible chat-completions service to explain only that supplied
evidence.

The chat model is instructed to prefer retrieved records, preserve uppercase
gene symbols, include groups/PDIS in lists, and acknowledge unavailable data.
Structured tissue, disease, binding, group, and PDIS requests use the same
evidence intersections. When the local intersection is empty, the assistant
queries PubMed and receives only retrieved abstracts. It must place one factual statement per line,
with a PMID and DOI on every line. The server buffers the answer, rejects
citations outside the retrieved evidence, and confirms through NCBI E-utilities
that every DOI belongs to its stated PubMed record before releasing text.
Source rules are evidence-specific: STRING claims cite a direct STRING
association link, Swiss-Prot annotations cite the UniProt entry, and connected
provider records cite their originating webserver. Only literature-derived
claims require a verified PMID and matching DOI. Missing, mismatched,
unreachable, or invented citations fail closed instead of
producing an unverified answer. A failed citation-format pass is rewritten once;
if it still fails, the assistant returns the verified PubMed article list rather
than a dead-end error. When KinomeX context is available, the assistant remains
restricted to that context.

Questions that ask which kinases satisfy a condition use a consistent table
with `Kinase`, `Evidence`, and `References` columns. Gene symbols are matched
back to the KinomeX catalog and link to `/kinases/[gene]`. Every externally
sourced row includes clickable PubMed and DOI links plus the literal PMID/DOI
pair used by server-side citation validation.

The research conversation is stored in browser `sessionStorage`. It survives
client-side navigation to other KinomeX pages and is restored when the user
returns to `/search`. Storage is scoped to the current browser tab/session,
retains at most the 40 messages accepted by the API, and is cleared explicitly
by **New Chat** or automatically when the browser session ends.

## Security and validation

Implemented boundaries include:

- allowlisted kinase groups and MongoDB sort fields;
- finite numeric parsing and range validation for pagination and PDIS;
- query length limits;
- escaping of user-derived MongoDB regular expressions;
- chat role, message-count, per-message, and total-size validation;
- generic client-facing database/LLM errors with detailed server-side logs;
- environment-only credentials;
- graceful launcher shutdown that verifies process working directory;
- GitHub Actions read-only repository permissions and workflow concurrency.

The project does **not** currently implement user accounts, authorization,
rate limiting, CSRF protection for authenticated operations, a persistent
distributed API cache, or an administrative web interface. Do not expose it as
an unrestricted public service without adding deployment-level protections
(TLS, rate limiting, request/body limits, monitoring, and database network
controls).

## Testing and quality checks

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand   # Jest unit/component tests
npx tsc --noEmit          # TypeScript checking
npm run lint              # Next.js ESLint rules
python3 -m compileall -q etl
bash -n run
git diff --check
```

The current suite covers cache behavior, query parsing, kinase utilities, API
validation, general utilities, and the PDIS badge component. MongoDB-backed API
integration tests, browser end-to-end tests, ETL contract fixtures, and live
upstream API tests are not yet included.

## Deployment

KinomeX requires a Node.js runtime because API routes use MongoDB and the chat
endpoint streams responses. A production deployment should provide:

1. a network-restricted MongoDB deployment with backups;
2. `MONGODB_URI` in the application runtime;
3. optional `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, and `LLM_MODEL`;
4. a separate execution environment for scheduled Python ETL;
5. repository secrets for the GitHub updater;
6. outbound access to the configured scientific APIs;
7. TLS, rate limiting, request logging, alerting, and uptime monitoring.

The default GitHub-hosted runner cannot reach a MongoDB instance bound only to
`localhost` or a private workstation. Use a securely network-accessible
database or an appropriately configured self-hosted runner. Never solve this by
opening MongoDB to the entire internet without authentication and network
controls.

Before release, run `npm run build`; development success alone does not verify
production rendering and bundling.

## Operations and troubleshooting

### Database connection failures

- Confirm MongoDB is running and accepts the configured URI.
- Confirm `.env.local` and `etl/.env` point to the same intended database.
- For hosted MongoDB, verify TLS options, credentials, IP/network rules, and DNS.
- The ETL driver uses a five-second server-selection timeout by default.

### Empty or partial database

- Inspect `etl/auto_populate.log` if the launcher stops during database
  preparation.
- Run `python3 -m etl.pipeline --list-steps` to verify the environment.
- Use the full pipeline for production; development seeding is intentionally
  incomplete compared with upstream ingestion.
- Inspect `etl_runs` for scheduled-update status and per-step failures.

### Upstream API failures

- Re-run only the failed target; dependencies are added automatically.
- Check provider status, response changes, rate limits, and API-key validity.
- A source failure may leave previously stored records available; it does not
  imply that all old records were deleted.

### Chat failures

- `501`: `LLM_API_KEY` is missing.
- `502`: the configured language-model endpoint rejected or failed the request.
- `503`: MongoDB context retrieval is unavailable.
- Confirm that `LLM_BASE_URL` is OpenAI-compatible and that `LLM_MODEL` exists.

### Stale interface data

- List and histogram endpoints use five-minute process-local caches.
- Wait for expiry or restart the server after a critical refresh.
- Browser favicons are aggressively cached; use a hard refresh after changes.

### Port shutdown is refused

`./run -s` intentionally refuses to terminate a listener whose current working
directory is not the KinomeX repository. Stop that process explicitly or use a
different KinomeX port.

## Known limitations

- PDIS remains unavailable until verified, kinase-scoped RCSB and ChEMBL
  imports have completed; missing scores are rendered as `N/A`.
- No user authentication or authorization layer is present.
- API caches are per-process and are neither shared nor explicitly invalidated
  after ETL updates.
- Some kinase profile references and ChEMBL target resolution depend on live
  third-party calls at request time.
- The reviewed UniProt Protein kinase keyword set is broader than some
  historical kinome definitions; counts can therefore differ by definition.
- Automated tests do not currently exercise a real MongoDB instance or live
  scientific APIs.
- Upstream schema changes can require ingestor maintenance.

## Data-integrity audit and synthetic-data removal

The July 31, 2026 audit recursively inspected every numeric value and source
field in every scientific collection. The reproducible reports are
`data-audit/audit-before.json` and `data-audit/audit-after.json`.

The initial audit found 10,263 demonstrably synthetic documents: all 3,885
bioactivities, 508 diseases, 3,265 expression measurements, 508 PDIS scores,
575 structures, and 1,522 variants. Every targeted document was exported as
MongoDB Extended JSON in a timestamped gzip backup before deletion. The final
audit contains 59,789 documents, zero records matching a synthetic signature,
and zero non-finite numbers:

| Collection | Final records | Provenance |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `kinases` | 678 | 522 KinHub core + 156 reviewed UniProt extensions |
| `catalog_metadata` | 1 | reproducible definition and partition counts |
| `expression` | 33,588 | GTEx v10 median gene expression |
| `variants` | 25,285 | NCBI ClinVar |
| `diseases` | 237 | UniProt disease comments |
| `pdis` | 0 | unavailable until all prerequisites are verified |
| `structures` | 0 | unavailable; broad organism-level fallback rejected |
| `bioactivities` | 0 | unavailable; non-target-scoped fallback rejected |

Run a non-mutating audit with:

```bash
node scripts/audit_database.mjs --output=data-audit/audit-current.json
node scripts/audit_kinase_catalog.mjs --output=data-audit/kinase-catalog-accounting.json
```

### Kinase-count accounting

“Human kinome” counts differ because papers and databases count genes,
proteins, or kinase domains. KinomeX therefore does not force these into one
unlabeled number. The current reconciled catalogue contains:

- 536 KinHub kinase-domain rows;
- 522 UniProt entries represented by those KinHub rows;
- 625 reviewed human UniProt entries carrying the controlled `Protein kinase`
  keyword, of which 469 overlap the KinHub roster;
- 53 additional KinHub accessions resolved from UniProt outside that keyword
  query; and
- 678 entries in the union: 522 KinHub core plus 156 reviewed-UniProt
  extensions.

One KinHub accession, PRKY/O43930, is retained and explicitly labeled as an
inactive historical UniProt record; it has no invented sequence length.
`data-audit/kinase-catalog-accounting.json` proves that both catalogue
partitions sum to the total, all 536 domain rows are represented, required
identifiers are present, and related scientific collections contain no orphan
gene symbols.

Preview the known synthetic signatures, then back up and remove matches:

```bash
node scripts/purge_synthetic_data.mjs
node scripts/purge_synthetic_data.mjs --apply
```

The purge command is dry-run by default. `--apply` verifies the backup and the
post-delete count for each collection. Backup payloads are excluded from Git.

## Scientific use and citation

When using KinomeX results, cite the original upstream database or publication
supporting each datum. The Manning human-kinome classification is based on:

> Manning G, Whyte DB, Martinez R, Hunter T, Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase
> complement of the human genome. *Science*. 2002;298:1912–1934.

KinomeX is an integration and exploration layer. It does not replace review of
primary literature, source-database records, or expert interpretation.
